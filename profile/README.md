We are an interdisciplinary ecology and environmental data science research group at the University of Florida.
We consist of [Ethan White](https://github.com/ethanwhite)’s lab which uses data science to understand ecological systems using large ecological and environmental datasets
and [Morgan Ernest](https://github.com/skmorgane)’s lab, which studies how ecological systems change through time and runs long-term monitoring efforts in the Everglades and the Arizona desert.
We do cutting edge research, collect and publish large open datasets, develop open source software, build websites,
train scientists in computational tools, and generally try to make science a better, more efficient, more diverse and inclusive place.
